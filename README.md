# SingleLayerPerceptron

Hello,

This program is a neural network with no hidden layers that is used to predict the market direction on a given day of Bitcoin. This is not the most effective network to use for this problem but a recurrent network is under development with hopes to gain a higher accuracy. The network has an accuracy of ~56%.  

To run this program simply cd to the directory and execute:

    python main.py

If you have both python 2 and python 3 on your machine run:

    python3 main.py

No extensions or additional libraries were used.

Thanks,

Thomas Cartotto
